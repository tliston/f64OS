;	And with that we can now talk about the interpreter.
;
;	In FORTH the interpreter function is often called DOCOL (I think it means "DO COLON" because
;	all FORTH definitions start with a colon, as in : DOUBLE DUP + ;
;
;	The "interpreter" (it's not really "interpreting") just needs to push the old %rsi on the
;	stack and set %rsi to the first word in the definition.  Remember that we jumped to the
;	function using JMP [%rax]?  Well a consequence of that is that conveniently %rax contains
;	the address of this codeword, so just by adding 8 to it we get the address of the first
;	data word.  Finally after setting up %rsi, it just does NEXT which causes that first word
;	to run.

;	Back to input, WORD is a FORTH word which reads the next full word of input.
;
;	What it does in detail is that it first skips any blanks (spaces, tabs, newlines and so on).
;	Then it calls KEY to read characters into an internal buffer until it hits a blank.  Then it
;	calculates the length of the word it read and returns the address and the length as
;	two words on the stack (with the length at the top of stack).
;
;	Notice that WORD has a single internal buffer which it overwrites each time (rather like
;	a static C string).  Also notice that WORD's internal buffer is just 32 bytes long and
;	there is NO checking for overflow.  31 bytes happens to be the maximum length of a
;	FORTH word that we support, and that is what WORD is used for: to read FORTH words when
;	we are compiling and executing code.  The returned strings are not NUL-terminated.
;
;	Start address+length is the normal way to represent strings in FORTH (not ending in an
;	ASCII NUL character as in C), and so FORTH strings can contain any character including NULs
;	and can be any length.
;
;	WORD is not suitable for just reading strings (eg. user input) because of all the above
;	peculiarities and limitations.

;	Note that when executing, you'll see:
;	WORD FOO
;	which puts "FOO" and length 3 on the stack, but when compiling:
;	: BAR WORD FOO ;
;	is an error (or at least it doesn't do what you might expect).  Later we'll talk about compiling
;	and immediate mode, and you'll understand why.

;	As well as reading in words we'll need to read in numbers and for that we are using a function
;	called NUMBER.  This parses a numeric string such as one returned by WORD and pushes the
;	number on the parameter stack.
;
;	The function uses the variable BASE as the base (radix) for conversion, so for example if
;	BASE is 2 then we expect a binary number.  Normally BASE is 10.
;
;	If the word starts with a '-' character then the returned value is negative.
;
;	If the string can't be parsed as a number (or contains characters outside the current BASE)
;	then we need to return an error indication.  So NUMBER actually returns two items on the stack.
;	At the top of stack we return the number of unconverted characters (ie. if 0 then all characters
;	were converted, so there is no error).  Second from top of stack is the parsed number or a
;	partial value if there was an error.

;	We're building up to our prelude on how FORTH code is compiled, but first we need yet more infrastructure.
;
;	The FORTH word FIND takes a string (a word as parsed by WORD -- see above) and looks it up in the
;	dictionary.  What it actually returns is the address of the dictionary header, if it finds it,
;	or 0 if it didn't.
;
;	So if DOUBLE is defined in the dictionary, then WORD DOUBLE FIND returns the following pointer:

;	able to go backwards (codeword -> dictionary entry) in order to decompile FORTH definitions

;	COMPILING ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	Now we'll talk about how FORTH compiles words.  Recall that a word definition looks like this:
;
;		: DOUBLE DUP + ;
;
;	and we have to turn this into:
;
;	  pointer to previous word
;	   ^
;	   |
;	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+--|---------+------------+------------+
;          ^       len                         pad  codeword      |
;	   |							  V
;	  LATEST points here				points to codeword of DUP
;
;	There are several problems to solve.  Where to put the new word?  How do we read words?  How
;	do we define the words : (COLON) and ; (SEMICOLON)?
;
;	FORTH solves this rather elegantly and as you might expect in a very low-level way which
;	allows you to change how the compiler works on your own code.
;
;	FORTH has an INTERPRET function (a true interpreter this time, not DOCOL) which runs in a
;	loop, reading words (using WORD), looking them up (using FIND), turning them into codeword
;	pointers (using >CFA) and deciding what to do with them.
;
;	What it does depends on the mode of the interpreter (in variable STATE).
;
;	When STATE is zero, the interpreter just runs each word as it looks them up.  This is known as
;	immediate mode.
;
;	The interesting stuff happens when STATE is non-zero -- compiling mode.  In this mode the
;	interpreter appends the codeword pointer to user memory (the HERE variable points to the next
;	free byte of user memory -- see DATA SEGMENT section below).
;
;	So you may be able to see how we could define : (COLON).  The general plan is:
;
;	(1) Use WORD to read the name of the function being defined.
;
;	(2) Construct the dictionary entry -- just the header part -- in user memory:
;
;    pointer to previous word (from LATEST)			+-- Afterwards, HERE points here, where
;	   ^							|   the interpreter will start appending
;	   |							V   codewords.
;	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
;                   len                         pad  codeword
;
;	(3) Set LATEST to point to the newly defined word, ...
;
;	(4) .. and most importantly leave HERE pointing just after the new codeword.  This is where
;	    the interpreter will append codewords.
;
;	(5) Set STATE to 1.  This goes into compile mode so the interpreter starts appending codewords to
;	    our partially-formed header.
;
;	After : has run, our input is here:
;
;	: DOUBLE DUP + ;
;	         ^
;		 |
;		Next byte returned by KEY will be the 'D' character of DUP
;
;	so the interpreter (now it's in compile mode, so I guess it's really the compiler) reads "DUP",
;	looks it up in the dictionary, gets its codeword pointer, and appends it:
;
;									     +-- HERE updated to point here.
;									     |
;									     V
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+
;                  len                         pad  codeword
;
;	Next we read +, get the codeword pointer, and append it:
;
;											  +-- HERE updated to point here.
;											  |
;											  V
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+
;                  len                         pad  codeword
;
;	The issue is what happens next.  Obviously what we _don't_ want to happen is that we
;	read ";" and compile it and go on compiling everything afterwards.
;
;	At this point, FORTH uses a trick.  Remember the length byte in the dictionary definition
;	isn't just a plain length byte, but can also contain flags.  One flag is called the
;	IMMEDIATE flag (F_IMMED in this code).  If a word in the dictionary is flagged as
;	IMMEDIATE then the interpreter runs it immediately _even if it's in compile mode_.
;
;	This is how the word ; (SEMICOLON) works -- as a word flagged in the dictionary as IMMEDIATE.
;
;	And all it does is append the codeword for EXIT on to the current definition and switch
;	back to immediate mode (set STATE back to 0).  Shortly we'll see the actual definition
;	of ; and we'll see that it's really a very simple definition, declared IMMEDIATE.
;
;	After the interpreter reads ; and executes it 'immediately', we get this:
;
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
;                  len                         pad  codeword					       ^
;												       |
;												    
;	STATE is set to 0.
;
;	And that's it, job done, our new definition is compiled, and we're back in immediate mode
;	just reading and executing words, perhaps including a call to test our new word DOUBLE.
;
;	The only last wrinkle in this is that while our word was being compiled, it was in a
;	half-finished state.  We certainly wouldn't want DOUBLE to be called somehow during
;	this time.  There are several ways to stop this from happening, but in FORTH what we
;	do is flag the word with the HIDDEN flag (F_HIDDEN in this code) just while it is
;	being compiled.  This prevents FIND from finding it, and thus in theory stops any
;	chance of it being called.
;
;	The above explains how compiling, : (COLON) and ; (SEMICOLON) works and in a moment I'm
;	going to define them.  The : (COLON) function can be made a little bit more general by writing
;	it in two parts.  The first part, called CREATE, makes just the header:
;
;						   +-- Afterwards, HERE points here.
;						   |
;						   V
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
;                  len                         pad
;
;	and the second part, the actual definition of : (COLON), calls CREATE and appends the
;	DOCOL codeword, so leaving:
;
;								+-- Afterwards, HERE points here.
;								|
;								V
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      |
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
;                  len                         pad  codeword
;
;	CREATE is a standard FORTH word and the advantage of this split is that we can reuse it to
;	create other types of words (not just ones which contain code, but words which contain variables,
;	constants and other data).

defcode "CREATE", CREATE
        ; Get the name length and address.
        pop rcx                 ; rcx = length
        pop rbx                 ; rbx = address of name

        ; Link pointer.
        mov rdi, [var_HERE]     ; rdi is the address of the header
        mov rax, [var_LATEST]   ; Get link pointer
        stosq                   ; and store it in the header.

        ; Length byte and the word itself.
        mov al, cl              ; Get the length.
        stosb                   ; Store the length/flags byte.
        push rsi
        mov rsi, rbx            ; rsi = word
        rep movsb               ; Copy the word
        pop rsi
        add rdi, 0b111          ; Align to next 8 byte boundary.
        and rdi, ~0b111

        ; Update LATEST and HERE.
        mov rax, [var_HERE]
        mov [var_LATEST], rax
        mov [var_HERE], rdi
        NEXT

;	Because I want to define : (COLON) in FORTH, not assembler, we need a few more FORTH words
;	to use.
;
;	The first is , (COMMA) which is a standard FORTH word which appends a 64 bit integer to the user
;	memory pointed to by HERE, and adds 8 to HERE.  So the action of , (COMMA) is:
;
;							previous value of HERE
;								 |
;								 V
;	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-- - - - - --+------------+
;	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 |             |  <data>    |

;                  len                         pad		              ^
;									      |
;									new value of HERE
;
;	and <data> is whatever 64 bit integer was at the top of the stack.
;
;	, (COMMA) is quite a fundamental operation when compiling.  It is used to append codewords
;	to the current word that is being compiled.

defcode ",", COMMA
        pop rax
        call _COMMA
        NEXT

_COMMA:
        mov rdi, [var_HERE]     ; HERE
        stosq                   ; Store it.
        mov [var_HERE], rdi     ; Update HERE (incremented)
        ret

;	Our definitions of : (COLON) and ; (SEMICOLON) will need to switch to and from compile mode.
;
;	Immediate mode vs. compile mode is stored in the global variable STATE, and by updating this
;	variable we can switch between the two modes.
;
;	For various reasons which may become apparent later, FORTH defines two standard words called
;	[ and ] (LBRAC and RBRAC) which switch between modes:
;
;	Word	Assembler	Action		Effect
;	[	LBRAC		STATE := 0	Switch to immediate mode.
;	]	RBRAC		STATE := 1	Switch to compile mode.
;
;	[ (LBRAC) is an IMMEDIATE word.  The reason is as follows: If we are in compile mode and the
;	interpreter saw [ then it would compile it rather than running it.  We would never be able to
;	switch back to immediate mode!  So we flag the word as IMMEDIATE so that even in compile mode
;	the word runs immediately, switching us back to immediate mode.

defcode "[", LBRAC, F_IMMED
        xor rax, rax
        mov [var_STATE], rax
        NEXT

defcode "]", RBRAC
        mov qword [var_STATE], 1
        NEXT

;	Now we can define : (COLON) using CREATE.  It just calls CREATE, appends DOCOL (the codeword), sets
;	the word HIDDEN and goes into compile mode.

defword ":", COLON

        dq CREATE
        dq LIT, DOCOL, COMMA
        dq LATEST, FETCH, HIDDEN
        dq RBRAC
        dq EXIT

;	; (SEMICOLON) is also elegantly simple.  Notice the F_IMMED flag.

;	EXTENDING THE COMPILER ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	Words flagged with IMMEDIATE (F_IMMED) aren't just for the FORTH compiler to use.  You can define
;	your own IMMEDIATE words too, and this is a crucial aspect when extending basic FORTH, because
;	it allows you in effect to extend the compiler itself.  Does gcc let you do that?
;
;	Standard FORTH words like IF, WHILE, ." and so on are all written as extensions to the basic
;	compiler, and are all IMMEDIATE words.
;
;	The IMMEDIATE word toggles the F_IMMED (IMMEDIATE flag) on the most recently defined word,
;	or on the current word if you call it in the middle of a definition.
;
;	Typical usage is:
;
;	: MYIMMEDWORD IMMEDIATE
;		...definition...
;	;
;
;	but some FORTH programmers write this instead:
;
;	: MYIMMEDWORD
;		...definition...
;	; IMMEDIATE
;
;	The two usages are equivalent, to a first approximation.

defcode "IMMEDIATE", IMMEDATE, F_IMMED
        mov rdi, [var_LATEST]
        add rdi, 8
        xor byte [rdi], F_IMMED
        NEXT

;	'addr HIDDEN' toggles the hidden flag (F_HIDDEN) of the word defined at addr.  To hide the
;	most recently defined word (used above in : and ; definitions) you would do:
;
;		LATEST @ HIDDEN
;
;	'HIDE word' toggles the flag on a named 'word'.
;
;	Setting this flag stops the word from being found by FIND, and so can be used to make 'private'
;	words.  For example, to break up a large word into smaller parts you might do:
;
;		: SUB1 ... subword ... ;
;		: SUB2 ... subword ... ;
;		: SUB3 ... subword ... ;
;		: MAIN ... defined in terms of SUB1, SUB2, SUB3 ... ;
;		HIDE SUB1
;		HIDE SUB2
;		HIDE SUB3
;
;	After this, only MAIN is 'exported' or seen by the rest of the program.

defcode "HIDDEN", HIDDEN
        pop rdi
        add rdi, 8
        xor byte [rdi], F_HIDDEN
        NEXT

defword "HIDE", HIDE
        dq $WORD
        dq FIND
        dq HIDDEN
        dq EXIT

;	' (TICK) is a standard FORTH word which returns the codeword pointer of the next word.
;
;	The common usage is:
;
;	' FOO ,
;
;	which appends the codeword of FOO to the current word we are defining (this only works in compiled code).
;
;	You tend to use ' in IMMEDIATE words.  For example an alternate (and rather useless) way to define
;	a literal 2 might be:
;
;	: LIT2 IMMEDIATE
;		' LIT ,		\ Appends LIT to the currently-being-defined word
;		2 ,		\ Appends the number 2 to the currently-being-defined word
;	;
;
;	So you could do:
;
;	: DOUBLE LIT2 * ;
;
;	(If you don't understand how LIT2 works, then you should review the material about compiling words
;	and immediate mode).
;
;	This definition of ' uses a cheat which I copied from buzzard92.  As a result it only works in
;	compiled code.  It is possible to write a version of ' based on WORD, FIND, >CFA which works in
;	immediate mode too.

defcode "'", TICK

;	BRANCHING ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	It turns out that all you need in order to define looping constructs, IF-statements, etc.
;	are two primitives.
;
;	BRANCH is an unconditional branch. 0BRANCH is a conditional branch (it only branches if the
;	top of stack is zero).
;
;	The diagram below shows how BRANCH works in some imaginary compiled word.  When BRANCH executes,
;	%rsi starts by pointing to the offset field (compare to LIT above):
;
;	+---------------------+-------+---- - - ---+------------+------------+---- - - - ----+------------+
;	| (Dictionary header) | DOCOL |            | BRANCH     | offset     | (skipped)     | word       |

;								  %esi added to offset
;
;	The offset is added to %rsi to make the new %rsi, and the result is that when NEXT runs, execution
;	continues at the branch target.  Negative offsets work as expected.
;
;	0BRANCH is the same except the branch happens conditionally.
;
;	Now standard FORTH words such as IF, THEN, ELSE, WHILE, REPEAT, etc. can be implemented entirely
;	in FORTH.  They are IMMEDIATE words which append various combinations of BRANCH or 0BRANCH
;	into the word currently being compiled.
;
;	As an example, code written like this:
;
;		condition-code IF true-part THEN rest-code
;
;	compiles to:
;
;		condition-code 0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest-code

;	LITERAL STRINGS ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	LITSTRING is a primitive used to implement the ." and S" operators (which are written in
;	FORTH).  See the definition of those operators later.
;
;	TELL just prints a string.  It's more efficient to define this in assembly because we
;	can make it a single Linux syscall.

;	QUIT AND INTERPRET ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	QUIT is the first FORTH function called, almost immediately after the FORTH system "boots".
;	As explained before, QUIT doesn't "quit" anything.  It does some initialisation (in particular
;	it clears the return stack) and it calls INTERPRET in a loop to interpret commands.  The
;	reason it is called QUIT is because you can call it from your own FORTH words in order to
;	"quit" your program and start again at the user prompt.
;
;	INTERPRET is the FORTH interpreter ("toploop", "toplevel" or "REPL" might be a more accurate
;	description -- see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL).

;	ODDS AND ENDS ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;	CHAR puts the ASCII code of the first character of the following word on the stack.  For example
;	CHAR A puts 65 on the stack.
;
;	EXECUTE is used to run execution tokens.  See the discussion of execution tokens in the
;	FORTH code for more details.
;
;	SYSCALL0, SYSCALL1, SYSCALL2, SYSCALL3 make a standard Linux system call.  (See <asm/unistd.h>
;	for a list of system call numbers).  As their name suggests these forms take between 0 and 3
;	syscall parameters, plus the system call number.
;
;	In this FORTH, SYSCALL0 must be the last word in the built-in (assembler) dictionary because we
;	initialise the LATEST variable to point to it.  This means that if you want to extend the assembler
;	part, you must put new words before SYSCALL0, or else change how LATEST is initialised.
;
;       The IN/OUT B/W functions will be useful for shutdown, talking to peripherals, and for the eventual
;       creation of a filesystem
